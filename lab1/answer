1. 
2. Blocking assignments will run one line at a time like a code, while non-blocking assignments will run concurrently.
3. Yes, as such. 
module shiftC(
    output q,
    input clock, d
    );
    parameter WIDTH = 4;
    reg [WIDTH-1:0] q;
    
    always @(posedge clock)
    begin
        q[0] <= d;
        q[WIDTH-1:1] <= q[WIDTH-2:0];
    end
endmodule

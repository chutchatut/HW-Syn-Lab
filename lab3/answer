1. Active high because when it is pressed down the output will connect with the 5v line.
2. Bounce is when switch is toggled and signal become unusable for a short period of time. You can avoid this by using debouncer and single pulser.
3.
module singlePulser(
    output reg Q,
    input D,
    input clk
    );
    reg last_state;
    
    initial
        last_state = 0;
    
    always @(posedge clk)
    begin
        last_state <= D;
        Q <= last_state == 0 && D == 1;
    end
endmodule
